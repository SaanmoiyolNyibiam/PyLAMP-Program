# Shell Navigation
`Shell`
`Bash`

Shell navigation entails moving around in th file structure of the operating
system by using the command line.

Commands are used to do this navigation,
and depending on type of shell, different set of commands are used.

This project explores the world of shell navigation.

## Learning Objectives
- How to navigate in an Unix system
- How to list files and directories
- How to display the content of a file
- How to create a file or directory
- How to remove a file or directory
- How to move or copy a file or directory

## Tasks
Note:
- For this project you will not have to push to github, so just enjoy navigating your shell environment and understand how each command works.
- For each task do not forget to
    - Validate the current directory using `pwd`.
    - Validate the content of the content directory using `ls`

### 0. Create
Access your Linux terminal and;

1. Navigate to home `~/`.
2. Create your working directory `shell_navigation/`
3. Change your working directory to `shell_navigation/`.
4. Then, create an empty file `so_cool`.

Tip: Don’t forget to display the list of files of your current directory to validate the creation of the new file.

### 1. Create more!
Access your Linux terminal and;

1. Change your working directory to `shell_navigation/`.
2. Create an empty file `school`.
3. Create folder a new folder `academics/`.
4. Then, copy the file `school` to `academics/`.

Tip: Don’t forget to display the list of files of your current directory to validate the copy of the file.

### 2. Rename
Access your Linux terminal and;

1. Change your working directory to `shell_navigation/`.
2. Create an empty file `old_school`.
3. Then, rename the file `old_school` to `new_school` (in the same directory).

Tip: Don’t forget to display the list of files of your current directory to validate the renaming of the file.

### 3. Create and Teleport!
Access your Linux terminal and;

1. Change your working directory to `shell_navigation/`.
2. Create an empty file `not_here`.
3. Create a new directory `shell_navigation/academics/right_school` while in the current directory.
4. Then, move the file `not_here` to `shell_navigation/academics/right_school`

Tip: Don’t forget to display the list of files of your current directory to validate the move of the file.

### 4. Create and remove
Access your Linux terminal and

1. Change your working directory to `shell_navigation/`
2. Create the file `ready_to_be_removed`
3. Then, delete the file `ready_to_be_removed`

Tip: Don’t forget to display the list of files of your current directory to validate the removal of the file.

### 5. Create another
Access your Linux terminal and

1. Change your working directory to `shell_navigation/`
2. Then, create a directory `school_is_amazing/`

Tip: Don’t forget to display the list of directories of your current directory to validate the creation of the directory.

### 6. Create and terminate
Access your Linux terminal and

1. Change your working directory to `shell_navigation/`
2. Create a new directory `empty_directory/`
3. Then, remove the directory `empty_directory/`

Tip: Don’t forget to display the list of directories of your current directory to validate the removal of the directory
