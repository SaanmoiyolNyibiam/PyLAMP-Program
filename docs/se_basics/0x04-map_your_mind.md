# Map Your Mind

As a Software Engineer, critical thinking is a trait one must have in order to design solutions that
solve problems most efficiently. This project unveils the thought process a Software Engineer should
have and the processes they could take to solve a problem.

## Learning Objectives
- What is a Pseudocode?
- why is Pseudocoding important in programming?
- How do you write Pseudocodes?

## Tasks

### Task 0
Develop an algorithm that calculates the sum of squares of given input of numbers.
You are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

### Task 1
Develop an algorithm that reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order.
You are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

### Task 2
Develop an algorithm that calculates a running sum.

A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result.
You are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

__General Tips:__
- You can make use of an online tool [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) for designing your flowcharts.
- Create the algorithm for each task into a flow chart, save a copy.
- Create a folder in google drive named `Map your mind` and upload your file there.
- Create pseudocode in a google doc and upload file to the folder as well.
- Make sure you give access to anyone with link for both pseudocode and flowchart files.
- Give access to anyone with link to the folder and forward your link to your PyLAMP Program instructor.
